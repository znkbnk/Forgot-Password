This guided project should provide
you with a structured approach to 
implementing a "Forgot Password" 
feature in a React application. 
Remember to adjust the steps as
needed based on your specific project
requirements and preferences. Happy coding!

Step 1: Set up a React Project

-  Create a new React project using your
preferred method (e.g., Create React
App or manually setting up webpack).
-  Set up the necessary dependencies
for the project, such as React Router
and Axios for API requests.

Step 2: Design the UI Components

-  Create a new component called
ForgotPasswordForm that will be
responsible for the UI of the
"Forgot Password" feature.
-  Design the form with input fields
for the user to enter their email address.
-  Add a submit button to initiate
the password reset process.

Step 3: Handle Form State and User Input

-  Add state to the ForgotPasswordForm
component to store the user's email address.
-  Implement event handlers to update the 
state when the user enters their email address.

Step 4: Implement API Request

-  Create a separate utility file to handle
API requests related to password reset.
-  Implement a function, let's say
sendPasswordResetEmail, that sends a 
POST request to the server with the
user's email address.
-  The server should handle the request
and send an email with a password reset
link to the user's email address.

Step 5: Handle Form Submission

-  Add an event handler to the submit 
button in the ForgotPasswordForm component.
-  In the event handler, call the
sendPasswordResetEmail function from 
the API utility file with the user's
email address as a parameter.
-  Handle any response or error
from the API request.

Step 6: Display Success or Error Message

-  Add state to the ForgotPasswordForm
component to store the success or error
message from the API response.
-  Based on the API response, update
the state with the appropriate message.
-  Display the success or error message
to the user below the form.

Step 7: Create a Password Reset
Confirmation Page

-  Create a new component called
ResetPasswordConfirmation to display a
confirmation message to the user after
they have requested a password reset.
-  Design the component to show a success
message and instructions for
resetting the password.

Step 8: Implement React Router

-  Set up React Router to handle navigation
between the ForgotPasswordForm component
and the ResetPasswordConfirmation component.
-  Create routes for both components and
set up the necessary links or buttons
to navigate between them.

Step 9: Test the Feature

-  Run the React application and test the
"Forgot Password" feature.
-  Enter a valid email address and submit
the form to trigger the password reset process.
-  Check the email associated with the entered
email address to ensure that a password
reset email is received.
-  Click on the password reset link
in the email and verify that the
ResetPasswordConfirmation page is displayed.
